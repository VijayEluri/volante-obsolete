What.
-----

NachoDB is an object-oriented, small, fast, free, embeddable database for .NET and Java.

Origin.
-------

NachoDB is a continuation of Perst database. Perst was licensed under liberal license
until version 2.49. In version 2.50 it was relicensed under dual GPL/commercial license.

NachoDB is a fork of the latest liberally licensed 2.49 version and is now developed
independently of Perst, preserving liberal license, so that you can use it
in both open-source and commercial code for free.
