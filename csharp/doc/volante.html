Volante is very simple object oriented embedded database. It is easy to use and
provide high performance. It is intended to be used in applications which needs to deal with persistent  data in more sophisticated way than load/store object tree provided but standard serialization mechanism. Although Volante is very simple, it provides fault tolerant support (ACID transactions)  and concurrent access to the database.

<P>The main advantage of Volante is tight integration with programming language.
There is no gap between database and application data models - Volante directly stores language objects. So there is no need in packing/unpacking code, which has to be written for traditional relational databases. Also Volante (unlike many other OODBMS) requires no special compiler or preprocessor. And still it is able to provide high level of transparency.

<H2> <A NAME = "features">Features</A></H2>
Lets now describe key features of Volante architecture. 

<H3> <A NAME = "pbs">Persistency by reachability</A></H3>

Volante is implementing <I>persistency by reachability</I> approach. Object of any class derived from <code>Persistent</code> base class is capable of being persisted. It is automatically made persistent and stored in the database when it is referenced from some other persistent object and <code>Store()</code> method of that object was invoked. So there is no need (but it is possible) to explicitlyassign object to the database.<P>

The database has one special <I>root</I> object. Root object is the only persistent object accessed in the special way (using <code>IDatabase.Root</code> property). All other persistent objects are accessed in normal way: either by traversing by references from another persistent objects, using object containers (<code>IIndex</code>, <code>Link</code> or <code>Relation</code>). Unlike many other OODBMS, there can be only one root in the database. If you need to have several named roots, you should create <code>IIndex</code> object and use it as root object.<P>

Volante requires that each persistent capable class should be derived from <code>Persistent</code> class. It makes not possible to store "foreign" classes in the database. This is the cost of easy use of Volante and lack of any specialized preprocessors or compilers. Also components of persistent capable object are restricted to have the following types:

<DL>
<DT>Scalar types
<DD>Any valid C# scalar type: boolean, integer, real or enum. For example <code>bool, int, short, double,...</code>
<DT>String type
<DD><code>System.String</code> type
<DT>Date type
<DD><code>System.DateTime</code> type
<DT>Reference to the persistent object
<DD>Any class inherited from <code>Persistent</code> or any interface extending <code>IPersistent</code> interface.
<DT>Value type
<DD>Any C# value type with the same restrictions for types of components as for persitent capable objects. Values are stored inside the persistent object containing them. 
<DT>Raw binary type
<DD>Any C# class not derived from <code>IPersistent</code> or <code>IValue</code> interfaces and marked as Serializable.
Standard C# serialization mechanism will be used to pack cluster of such objects into byte array which will be 
stored in the database. The class should be marked with <code>Serializable</code> attribute
and should not contain references to persistent objects. 
<DT>Array type
<DD>One dimensional array with type of the components described above
<DT>Link type
<DD>One-to-many link or from implementation point of view - dynamic array of persistent object.
Links are created using <code>IDatabase.CreateLink()</code> method.
</DL><P>

Unfortunately it is not possible to detect if object is changed or not without saving old state of the object and performing field-by-field comparison with new state of the object. But overhead of such solution (both space and CPU) is very high. In Volante it is responsibility of programmer to save object in the database. It can be done by <code>Persistent.Store()</code> method. or <code>Persistent.Modify()</code> methods.<P>

<code>Persistent.Store()</code> method writes object to the database as well as all objects referenced from this object which are not yet persistent. So if you create tree of objects and assign reference to the root of this tree to some persistent object <B>X</B>, it is only necessary toinvoke <code>Store()</code> method in this object <B>X</B>. But then if you update one of the elements in this tree,you should invoke <code>Store()</code> individually for each such element (<code>X.Store()</code> will NOT now automatically save referenced objects).<P>

<code>Persistent.Modify()</code> method mark object is modified but doesn't immediately write it to the database. All objects marked as modified will be stored in the database during transaction commit (<code>Store()</code> method will be invoked for each modified object). So using <code>Modify()</code> method is preferable if object is updated multiple times within transaction. In this case instead of storing it several times, it will be stored only once at the end.<P>

<H3> <A NAME = "load">Semitransparent object loading</A></H3>

Volante is not using any special compiler or preprocessor. And since C# doesn't provide
runtime behavior reflection (changing behavior of object at runtime), it is not possible to implement completely transparent persistence (when there are no differences between access to transient and persistent objects). Instead of it Volante propose transparent behavior in most cases with some exceptions.<P>

<code>IPersistent</code> interface declares <code>RecursiveLoading()</code> method. Default implementation of  this method in <code>Persistent</code> class always returns <code>true</code>. In this case Volante will recursively load any object referenced from target object when target object is loaded. So it cause implicit loading of all cluster of referenced objects from database to main memory. It is similar with how serialization mechanism works.<P>

To avoid overflow of main memory caused by recursive loading of all objects from the database, programmer has to overload <code>RecursiveLoading()</code> method in some classes and return <code>false</code> in it. Objects loaded from such object will not be implicitly loaded and programmer has to explicitly invoke <code>Persistent.Load()</code> method to load them. So <code>RecursiveLoading()</code> method can be used to control loading of objects from database to main memory.<P>

Also it is important to notice that containers (<code>Link, Relation, IIndex</code>) always load member objects on demand (do not perform automatic loading of all objects in the containers). Since access to the container members is always performed through methods of the container class, programmer will never notice it - container methods will always return loaded object(s).<P>

Volante is using default constructor (constructor without parameters) to create object loaded from the database. It means the following things:
<OL>
<LI>All persistent capable classes should have default constructor (or have no constructor at all, in this case
it will be automatically generated by compiler). Default constructor should not necessarily be public, it can have any
access type. 
<LI>Default constructor should initialize only transient fields. 
<LI>Default constructor is used to create instance of the persistent object loaded from the database. So at the time of default constructor execution field of the constructed object are not yet assigned values stored in the database. If you need these values to be able to perform initialization of transient fields, then you need to perform this initialization in <code>OnLoad()</code> method which is invoked after fetching of all values of non-transient fields of persistent object from the database. 
</OL><P>

To summarize: the mechanism is convenient and easy to use because it doesn't require programmer
to explicitly load any referenced objects. It's also flexible by giving the programmer control
over object loading. Only those classes (usually containers) which explicitly control loading
of their members (by overloading <code>RecursiveLoading()</code> to return <code>false</code>)
should need to use <code>Persistent.Load()</code> method.<P>

<H3> <A NAME = "scheme">Automatic scheme evaluation</A></H3>

Volante supports lazy automatic scheme evaluation. When class format is changed, 
Volante perform conversion of loaded object to new format. If this object is modified, 
it will be stored in new format. So object is converted to the new format on demand.
Volante is able to handle the following scheme changes:

<OL>
<LI>Compatible change of scalar type (change which could not cause data truncation).
For example it is possible to change <code>int</code> type to <code>long</code> or 
<code>int</code> to <code>float</code>. But changing type from <code>int</code> to
<code>short</code> is not possible. More precisely, Volante is able to perform any conversion
which is supported by .NET reflection mechanism (field type XXX can be changed to YYY
if <code>java.lang.reflect.Field.setXXX</code> method can be applied to the component with type YYY).
<LI>Reordering components within class or moving component to base or derived class.
<LI>Adding/removing classes from class inheritance hierarchy.
<LI>Changing format of classes with value semantic. 
</OL><P>

All other schema modifications (such as renaming fields, incompatible change of field type)
could not be handled by Volante automatic schema modification mechanism. 
In this case you can use Volante XML export/import mechanism. Database can be 
exported to XML format using <code>IDatabase.ExportXML()</code> method, 
then recreated with new class definitions and  after it saved data can be imported using 
<code>IDatabase.ImportXML()</code> method.<P>


<H3> <A NAME = "relations">Relations</A></H3>

CSharp references provides a way to implement one-to-one relation between objects.
But in many cases one-to-many and many-to-many relations are needed. 
Volante provides <code>Link</code> interface to deal with relations of such kind.
This interface allows to add/delete/inspect members of the relation.
Members of the relation can be accessed by index or be extracted as array of objects.<P>

Relations can be of two kinds: <I>embedded</I> (when references to the related objects are stored in relation owner object itself) and <I>standalone</I> (when relation is separate object, which contains the reference to the relation owner and relation members). Both kinds of relations
implements Link interface. Embedded relation is created by <code>IDatabase.CreateLink()</code> method and standalone relation is represented by Relation persistent class created by <code>IDatabase.CreateRelation()</code> method.<P>

So relation between two classes A and B can be implemented in the following way:<P>

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>Relation type</TH><TH>Object A</TH><TH>Object B</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>one-to-one</TD><TD><code>B bref;</code></TD><TD><code>A aref;</code></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>one-to-many</TD><TD><code>Link bref;</code></TD><TD><code>A aref;</code></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>many-to-one</TD><TD><code>B bref;</code></TD><TD><code>Link aref;</code></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>many-to-many</TD><TD><code>Link bref;</code></TD><TD><code>Link aref;</code></TD></TR>
</TABLE><P>

<H3> <A NAME = "indices">Indices</A></H3>

Usually objects are accessed by traversing from one object to another using references or links.
But it is frequently needed to locate object by key. In .NET <code>Hashtable</code> class
can be used for it. In databases usually more sophisticated search is required. 
I do not want to implement in Volante complete SQL language, because it immediately makes DBMS huge and slow.
But in most cases application is performing only very simple queries using exact match or key range.
This is done in Volante by <code>Index</code> and <code>IndexField</code> interfaces. First interface is used
for independent specification key and associated value. <code>IndexField</code> interface allows to index objects
using one of the fields of this object (key field).<P>


Indices are created in Volante using <code>IDatabase.CreateIndex()</code> or <code>IDatabase.CreateFieldIndex()</code> methods. 
There can be several index implementations
but right now only one implementation based on B+Tree is provided (because B+Tree is the most efficient structure
for disk based databases). Methods of <code>Index</code> and <code>FieldIndex</code> interface allows to add, remove and 
locate objects by key. It is possible to perform search either specifying exact key value either specifying range of key values
(high or low boundary or both of them can be skipped or can be declared as been exclusive or inclusive).
So it is possible to perform the following types of search:<P>

<OL>
<LI>key is equals to VAL
<LI>key belongs to [MIN_VAL, MAX_VAL]
<LI>key belongs to [MIN_VAL, MAX_VAL)
<LI>key belongs to (MIN_VAL, MAX_VAL]
<LI>key belongs to (MIN_VAL, MAX_VAL)
<LI>key is greater than MIN_VAL
<LI>key is greater or equals to MIN_VAL
<LI>key is less than than MAX_VAL
<LI>key is less than or equals to MAX_VAL
</OL><P>

There are several different ways of selecting objects using index:
<DL>
<DT><code>IPersistent get(Key key)</code>
<DD>Get object by key. This method should be used for unique indices to locate object by exact key value.
<DT><code>IPersistent[] get(Key from, Key till)</code>
<DD>Get array of objects with key belonging to the specified range. Either from boundary, either till boundary either both of them can be <code>null</code>. Both boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive.
<DT><code>IEnumerator GetEnumerator()</code>
<DD>Get iterator which will traverse all objects in the index in key ascending order.
You can use index in <code>foreach</code> construction to iterate through all indexed objects. 
<DT><code>IEnumerator GetEnumerator(Key from, Key till, IterationOrder order)</code>
<DD>Get iterator for objects with key belonging to the specified range. Either from boundary, either till boundary either both of them can be <code>null</code>. Both boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive. Objects can be traversed in key ascending or descending order .
</DL><P>

If you need set of persistent objects you should use <code>IDatabase.CreateSet()</code> method.
Set is implemented using B+Tree where object OID is used as a key.<P> 

Volante also support spatial indices (<code>SpatialIndex</code>) and generic indices with
user defined comparator (<code>SortedCollection</code>).Spatial index is implemented using Guttman's R-Tree with quadratic split algorithm. It allows efficient search of R2 objects. Sorted collection provides almost the same methods as <code>FieldIndex</code> but it uses user defined comparator to compare collection members. Sorted collection is implemented using T-Tree and is especially efficient for main-memory databases.</P>

<H3> <A NAME = "projection">Projection</A></H3>

Using Volante indices programmer can easily implement most of simple SQL queries, like:

<pre>
    select * from T where x=?;
</pre>

Volante relations can be used to implement simple joins, 
like the following SQL query fetching all order to the particular vendor:

<pre>
    select * from O Order, V Vendor where O.vendorID = V.id AND V.name='ABC';
</pre>

In Volante it is possible to select first vendor using index search and ten traverse 
correspondent relation to locate all orders to this vendor.<P>

But sometimes it is needed to implement more complex queries.
It is also possible in Volante without need to write query in some special 
(non-procedural) language. Class <code>Projection</code> is use to combine results
of several simple operations (such index search). Lets start explanation of this class with an 
example. Consider that we need to know all order for the detail with name started with 'D1' 
shipped by vendors with name started with 'V1' or 'V3'. 
SQL statement which perform this query is the following:

<pre>
    select * from O Order, V Vendor, D Detail where D.name like 'D1%' and O.detailID = D.id
        and O.vendorID = V.id and (V.name like 'V1%' OR V.name like 'V3%');
</pre>


And now how it can be done in Volante. Consider that we have indices for 
details and vendors:

<pre>
    FieldIndex detailIndex = db.CreateFieldIndex(typeof(Detail), "name", true);
    FieldIndex vendorIndex = db.CreateFieldIndex(typeof(Vendor), "name", true);
</pre>


Set of requested orders can be obtained in the following way:

<pre>
    //  Projection from vendors to orders (using "orders" field of Link type)
    Projection v2o = new Projection(typeof(Vendor), "orders");
    //  Projection from details to orders (using "orders" field of Link type)
    Projection d2o = new Projection(typeof(Detail), "orders");
    // Select vendors with name like 'V1%'
    v2o.Project(vendorIndex.StartsWith("V1"));
    // Select vendors with name like 'V3%'
    v2o.Project(vendorIndex.StartsWith("V3"));
    // Select details with name like 'D1%'
    d2o.Project(detailIndex.StartsWith("D1"));
    // Join projections
    v2o.Join(d2o);
    // Get array of requested orders
    Order[] orders = (Order[])v2o.ToArray(typeof(Order)]);
</pre>

So, as you see Projection class is used for several purposes:

<OL>
<LI>Combine result of several simple operations (implementing OR operator)
<LI>Eliminate duplicates of such merge
<LI>Get set of related objects (perform projection using specified projection field)
<LI>Join several projections (analogue of SQL JOIN)
</OL><P>

It is possible to derive your own class from <code>Projection</code> to implement 
more sophisticated projections than using single projection field.<P>

If you need to sort selection in some particular order, then most efficient way 
is to use <code>FieldIndex</code> for it. When you select objects using index, selected objects
are sorted by search key. If you need to sort selection by field which is not search key, 
than you can use <code>Array.Sort</code> method. For example if in the query described above
we need to sort orders by price field, it can be done with the following statement:

<pre>
    Array.Sort(orders, Order.PriceComparer);
</pre><P>


<H3> <A NAME = "transaction">Transaction model</A></H3>

<p>Volante maintains consistency of the data in case of system or application crash. Transaction mechanism is used to implement all-or-nothing database update. Transaction in Volante is started implicitly when update operation is performed for the first time and finished explicitly by <code>Commit()</code>, <code>Rollback()</code> or <code>Close()</code> method.</p>

<p>Transaction commit causes synchronous write of changed pages to the disk. Synchronous write is an expensive operation: application is blocked until all data is flushed to disk. Average seek time for modern disks is about 10ms, so they are usually only able to perform 100 random writes in one second. Since a transaction usually consists of several updated pages, it leads to average performance of about 10 transaction commits per second.</p>

<p>Performance can be greatly increased by minimizing number of commits (larger transactions). Volante is using shadow mechanism for transaction implementation. When object is changed first time during transaction, shadow of the object is created and original object is kept unchanged. If object is updated multiple times during transaction, shadow is create only once. Because of using shows, Volante do not need transaction log file. So in Volante long transaction can not cause transaction log overflow as in most of other DBMSes. Quite the contrary, if you do not call commit at all, Volante works as DBMS without transaction support, adding almost no overhead of supporting transactions.</p>

<p>The only drawback of long transactions is possibility of loosing a lot of changes in case of a crash. Volante will preserve consistency of the database but all changes made since last commit will be lost.</p>

<H2> <A NAME = "transparent">Transparent API's</A></H2>
<H3> <A NAME = "remoting">Using .Net remoting API</A></H3>

.Net framework provides System.Runtime.Remoting package for easy
implementation of distributed applications. Programmer should only derived
its class from ContextBoundObject and use ContextAttribute which is responsible
for providing <i>message sink</i>: mechanism for controlling invocation of methods and access
to fields of the object. Using this API its is possible to implement not only distributed
system, but also any system based on <i>metaobject protocol</i>: protocol of controlling
behavior of the object. For example it is possible to implement transparent interface to object
oriented database using this API.<p>

Volante includes two classes PersistentContext and TransparentPersistenceAttrribute
which are used to provide transparent persistence for C# objects using .Net remoting API. 
If application class is derived from PersistentContext and marked with TransparentPersistence 
attribute, it will automatically load on demand its content from the database and 
automatically store content if the object is modified. Implementation of 
<code>recursiveLoading</code> method in <code>PersistentContext</code> class returns false, 
so object are loaded from the database only when them are accessed.<P>

But there are two significant restrictions on using remoting API:
<UL>
<LI>Remoting API can handle only public members of the class
<LI>It cause significant performance overhead (invocation of method through remoting API
is about 100 times slower than normal method invocation).
</UL><P>

<code>TransparentGuess</code> example illustrates using of Volante transparent API.<p>

<H3><A NAME = "props">Using virtual properties</A></H3>

Yet another attempt to build transparent API to Volante without using special
preprocessor (enhancer) is based on the idea of using virtual properties.
Unlike Java, C# provides property mechanism which allows to encapsulate 
representation of object component. Idea originally proposed by 
<A href="shiziye@hotmail.com">Shi Ziye</A> is very simple - generate wrapper class
which will implement these properties. So programmer should not worry any more
about cutting recursive loading of objects by redefinition of
<code>IPersistent.RecursiveLoading</code> method and explicit loading 
of object using <code>IPersistent.Load</code> method or about explicit
marking of updated object by <code>IPersistent.Modify</code> method.
So a lot of error prone things are disappears. But certainly this approach has their 
own drawbacks:

<OL>
<LI>Your persistent objects can not have persistent fields, instead of it
you should define abstract properties (it is also possible to define properties
in interface). Fortunately C# provides convenient mechanism for working
with properties, so it will significantly complicates programming. 
<LI>You can not create persistent object by new operator - you should
use <code>IDatabase.CreateClass()</code> method which will generate wrapper class
and create instance of this class. Also persistent class should have no constructor
except default. And this default constructor should not do something else except 
initialization of transient components, because this constructor will be invoked each time 
object is loaded from the database.
<LI>It is not possible to have arrays of references. You have to use 
<code>Volante.PArray</code> class instead.
<LI>Generation of wrapper classes is not cheap operations, so if there are many classes
in your applications, then it can take significant time when opening a database .
<LI>This mechanism will not work in Compact.Net framework 
because it doesn't support code generation at runtime.
</OL><P>

There are two possible ways of defining persistent classes using this API.
First is based in using interfaces:

<pre>
class Node:IPersistent {
    int Weight {
        get;
        set;
    }
    Node Parent { 
        get;
        set;
    }
}
</pre>

Please notice that you should extend IPersistent interface.
In this case Volante will derive generated wrapper class from
<code>Volante.Persistent</code> class (or from <code>Volante.PersistentResource</code> class 
if specified interface extends <code>Volante.IResource</code> interface).
Wrapper class will implement specified interface and contains correspondent fields:

<pre>
class NodeWrapper : Persistent, Node {
    public int Weight {
        get {
            return weight;
        }
        set {
            weight = value;
            Modify();
        }
    }
    public Node Parent {
        get {
            return (Node)IDatabase.getByOid(parent);
        }
        set {
            parent = value.MakePersistent(Database);
            Modify();
        }
    }
}
</pre>

         
In the second case you are using abstract class instead of interface:

<pre>
interface Node:Persistent {
    public abstract int Weight {
        get;
        set;
    }
    public abstract Node Parent { 
        get;
        set;
    }
}
</pre>

This class has to be derived from Persistent or PersistentResource class.
There is only one difference in generated wrapper class - it extends specified 
abstract class:

<pre>
class NodeWrapper:Node {
    ...
}
</pre><p>

As far as there are not direct references between objects when this API is used, 
garbage collector will remove from memory all persistent objects which are not referenced
from some program variables. That is why it is highly recommended to use LRU object cache
to increase performance (it is used by default).<p>

<code>PropGuess</code> example illustrates using of this Volante transparent API.<p>


<H2> <A NAME = "implementation">Volante implementation issues</A></H2>

Below is more detailed description of Volante implementation.
This section can be skipped if you are not interested in the details of implementation:<P>


<H3> <A NAME = "memory">Memory allocation</A></H3>

Memory allocation is performed in Volante by bitmap. Memory is allocated in
chunks called allocation quantum. In current version of Volante size of
allocation quantum is 64 byte. It means that size of all allocated objects is
aligned on 64 byte boundary. Each 64 byte of database memory is represented by
one bit in the bitmap. To locate hole of requested size in bitmap, Volante
sequentially searches bitmap pages for correspondent number of successive
cleared bits. Volante uses three arrays indexed by bitmap byte, which
makes possible fast calculation of hole offset and size within the byte.<P>

Volante performs cyclic scanning of bitmap pages. It keeps identifier
of current bitmap page and current position within the page. Each time
when allocation request arrives, scanning of the bitmap starts from the
current position.
When last allocated bitmap page is scanned, scanning continues from the
beginning (from the first bitmap page) and until current position.
When no free space is found after full cycle through all bitmap pages,
new bulk of memory is allocated. Size of extension is maximum of
size of allocated object and extension quantum. Extension quantum is parameter
of database, specified in constructor. Bitmap is extended to be able to map
additional space. If virtual space is exhausted and no more
bitmap pages can be allocated, then <code>OutOfMemory</code> error
is reported.<P>

Allocation memory using bitmap provides high locality of references
(objects are mostly allocated sequentially) and also minimizes
number of modified pages. Minimization of number of modified pages is
significant when commit operation is performed and all dirty pages should
be flushed on the disk. When all cloned objects are placed sequentially,
number of modified pages is minimal and so transaction commit time is also
reduced. Using extension quantum also helps to
preserve sequential allocation. Once bitmap is extended, objects will
be allocated sequentially until extension quantum will be completely used.
Only after reaching the end of the bitmap, scanning restarts from the beginning
searching for holes in previously allocated memory.<P>


To reduce number of bitmap pages scans, Volante associates descriptor with
each page, which is used to remember maximal size of the hole on the page.
Calculation of maximal hole size is performed in the following way:
if object of size <I>M</I> can not be allocated from this bitmap pages,
then maximal hole size is less than <I>M</I>, so <I>M</I>
is stored in the page descriptor if previous value of descriptor is large
than <I>M</I>. For next allocation of object of size greater or
equal than <I>M</I>, we will skip this bitmap page. Page descriptor
is reset when some object is deallocated within this bitmap page.<P>

Some database objects
(like hash table pages) should be aligned on page boundary
to provide more efficient access. Volante memory  allocator checks requested
size and if it is aligned on page boundary, then address of
allocated memory segment is also aligned on page boundary. Search of free hole
will be done faster in this case, because Volante increases step of current
position increment according to the value of alignment.<P>

To be able to deallocate memory used by object, Volante needs to keep
somewhere
information about object size. Volante memory allocator deals with two types
of objects - normal table records and page objects.
All table records are prepended by record header, which contains
record size and pointer of L2-list linking all records in the table.
So size of the table record object can be extracted from record header.
Page objects always occupies the whole database page are are allocated at
the positions aligned on page boundary. Page objects has no headers.
Volante distinguish page objects
with normal object by using special marker in object index.<P>


<H3> <A NAME = "logless">Shadow transaction mechanism</A></H3>

Each record (object) in Volante has unique identifier (OID).
Object identifiers
are used to implement references between objects. To locate object by
reference, its OID is used as index in array of object offsets within the file.
This array is called <I>object index</I> and element of this array -
<I>object handle</I>. These are two copies of object
indices in Volante, one of which is current and other - shadow.
Header of database contains pointers to both object indices and indicator
which index is current at this moment.<P>

When object is modified first time, it is cloned
(copy of the object is created) and object handle in current index is
changed to point to newly created object copy. And shadow index still
contains handle which points to the original version of the object.
All changes are done with the object copy, leaving original object unchanged.
Volante marks in special bitmap page of the object index, which contains
modified object handle.<P>

When transaction is committed, Volante first checks if size of object index
was increased during current transaction. If so, it also reallocates shadow
copy of object index. Then Volante frees memory for all "old objects",
i.e. objects which was cloned within transaction. Memory can not be
deallocated before commit, because we wants to preserve consistent
state of the database by keeping cloned object unchanged.
If we deallocate memory immediately after cloning, new object can be
allocated at the place of cloned object and we loose
consistency. As far as memory deallocation is done in Volante by bitmap
using the same transaction mechanism as for normal database objects,
deallocation of object space will require clearing some bits in bitmap page,
which also should be cloned before modification. Cloning bitmap page will
require new space for allocation the page copy, and we can reuse space of
deallocated objects. And it is not acceptable due to the reason explained
above - we will loose database consistency. That is why deallocation
of object is done in two steps. When object is cloned, all bitmap pages
used for marking objects space, are also cloned (if not
not cloned before). So when transaction is committed, we only clear bits in
bitmap pages and no more requests for allocation memory can be generated at
this moment.<P>

After deallocation of old copies, Volante flushes all modified pages on disk
to synchronize content of the memory and disk file. After that Volante
changes current object index indicator in database
header to switch roles of the object indices. Now object index, which was
current becomes shadow, and shadow index becomes current. Then Volante again
flushes modified page (i.e. page with database header) on disk, transferring
database to new consistent state.
After that Volante copies all modified handles from new object index
to object index which was previously shadow and now becomes current.
At this moment contents of both indices is synchronized and Volante is ready
to start new transaction.<P>

Bitmap of modified object index pages is used to minimize time of committing
transaction. Not the whole object index, but only its modified pages should be
copied. After committing of transaction bitmap is cleared.<P>

When transaction is explicitly aborted by <code>IDatabase.Rollback()</code>
method, shadow object index is copied back to the current index, eliminating
all changes done by aborted transaction. After the end of copying,
both indices are identical again and database state corresponds to the moment
before the start of current transaction.<P>

Allocation of object handles is done by free handles list. Header of the list
is also shadowed and two instances of list headers are stored in database
header. Switch between them is done in the same way as switch of
object indices. When there are no more free elements in the list, Volante
allocates handles from the unused part of new index. When there is no
more space in the index, it is reallocated. Object index is the only
entity in database whose is not cloned on modification. Instead of this
two copies of object index are always used.<P>

There are some predefined OID values in Volante. OID <I>0</I> is reserved
as invalid object identifier. OID starting from <I>1</I> are reserved for bitmap pages.
Number of bitmap pages depends on database maximum virtual space.
For one terabyte virtual space, 8 Kb page size and 64 byte allocation quantum,
32K bitmap pages are required. So 32K handles are reserved in object index for
bitmap. Bitmap pages are allocated on demand, when database size is extended.
So OID of first users object will be 0x8002.<P>

Recovery procedure is trivial in Volante. There are two instances of
object index, one of which is current and another corresponds to
consistent database state. When database is opened, Volante checks database
header to detect if database was normally closed. If not
(<code>dirty</code> flag is set in database header), then Volante performs
database recovery. Recovery is very similar to rollback of transaction.
Indicator of current index in database object header is used to
determine index corresponding to consistent database state and object handles
from this index are copied to another object index, eliminating
all changes done by uncommitted transaction. As far as the only action
performed by recovery procedure is copying of objects index (really only
handles having different values in current and shadow indices are copied to
reduce number of modified pages) and size of object index is small,
recovery can be done very fast.
Fast recovery procedure reduces "out-of-service" time of application.<P>

Volante is simple and fast embedded database engine. 
If your applications need embedded database engine and do not need to execute complex SQL queries, 
and the only thing you need is to be able to store/fetch/locate object in the database using navigation 
through references or indexed search by key, then Volante is what you need. It will provide much better performance
than relational database and other (more sophisticated) object oriented database.<P>

The table below summarize <B>pro</B> features of Volante:<P>

<H2><A NAME = "tuning">Tuning</A></H2>

This sections contains several hints how to adjust Volante parameters and increase database performance.<P>

Speed of accessing data at the disk is several times slower than speed of access data in main memory. 
That is why caching of data is the key to increase database performance. Volante is using 
pool of pages to optimize access to the disk. Page pool size can be specified in <code>IDatabase.Open()</code>
method (by default it is 4Mb). Usually increasing page pool leads to better performance. But you should 
notice the following things:

<UL>
<LI>There is can be a limit for maximal size of memory used by application.

<LI>If you specify very large pool size, leaving no free memory for other applications and operating system, 
then swapping will cause significant performance degradation.

<LI>Operating system itself maintains file buffers.
So data is cached twice. Certainly accessing data from page pool is much faster than from 
operating system cache, because in this case no operating system calls and context switches are needed. 

<LI>It is not possible to specify empty page pool (leaving all caching for operating system).
When data is access from the page, it is pinned in page pool. So page pool should contain enough entries
to keep all pinned pages. So do no make page pool size less then 64kb.
</UL><P>

If you think that all your data should fit in main memory, you can use
<code>Storage.INFINITE_PAGE_POOL</code> constant in <code>IDatabase.Open()</code> method.
In this case page pool will be dynamically extended when new page is requested. 
As a result, all pages will be cached and present in memory. So each page is read from the disk only once. 
Also in this case strong object cache is used instead of weak object cache. It means that all fetched
objects are also pinned in memory and object is unpacked only once. It is important to notice
that amount of used main memory will be greater than database size: all objects will be present in memory in packed
(inside the page containing the object) and in unpacked (referenced from object cached) form.<P>

In some applications (for example for mobile devices) persistency is not needed. But such Volante container classes
as Link, Index, FieldIndex, SpatialIndex still can be used by application. In this case you can use
<code>NullFile</code> implementation of <code>IFile</code> interface together
with <code>Storage.INFINITE_PAGE_POOL</code> to create transient in-memory database. Data in this case will never be 
written on the disk.<P> 

There are some constants defined in <code>DatabaseImpl</code> class which has influence on
initial and maximal database size. If you want to change them, you will have to rebuild Volante.
Below is detailed description of this parameters:<P>

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>Parameter</TH><TH>Default value</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>
<TR><TD><code>dbDefaultInitIndexSize</code></TD><TD>1024</TD>
<TD>Initial object index size. Object index is increased on demand. Reallocation of index is
expensive operation and so to minimize number of such reallocations, object index size is always doubled.
Specifying larger initial index size allows to reduce number of future reallocations and so a little bit increase
performance (certainly if your application allocates such number of object). But it also leads to larger initial
size of database file. With default value of this parameter, initial database size is about 50Kb.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>dbDefaultExtensionQuantum</code></TD><TD>4Mb</TD>
<TD>Database extension quantum. 
Memory is allocate by scanning bitmap. If there is no large enough hole, then database is extended by the value of 
<code>dbDefaultExtensionQuantum</code>. Increasing the value of this parameters leads to less frequent 
rescanning of allocation bitmap from the very beginning. It leads to faster allocation speed and better locality of 
reference for created objects (because there is more chances that them will be allocated sequentially). 
From the other side it leads to less efficient memory usage. Reducing the value of this parameter force reusing 
of existed holes in memory allocation bitmap. 
</TD></TR>


<TR><TD><code>dbObjectCacheInitSize</code></TD><TD>1319</TD>
<TD>Size of object cache. Volante needs this cache to check if object with such OID already 
present in memory. This cache uses weak references to allow garbage collector to do it work. 
When some threshold of filling cache is reached, cached is reallocated by doubling its size.
Once again increasing this parameter can save some number of cache reallocations.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE><P>

Now some hints how to increase Volante performance and reduce size of used main memory.
If you database performs a lot of updates of persistent data, then the main limiting factor is speed 
of writing changes to the disk. Especially synchronous write to the disk performed by commit.
If you will do commit after each update, then average speed will be about 10 updates per second 
(this estimation is based on the assumption than average disk access time is about 10msec and
each transaction commit usually requires writing about 10 pages in random places in the file).
But it is possible to dramatically increase update performance if you group several updates in 
one transactions. Volante is creating shadow of the object when it is
first time updated inside transaction. If object will be updated once in N transactions, 
then N shadows will be created. If object will be updated N times inside one transaction, then
shadow will be created only once. It explains advantage of having one large transaction.<P>

But if you will perform update of large number of objects in one transaction and for each updated
object shadow is created, then it leads to significant increase of database file size.
If you update each object in the database inside one transaction, database size will be 
almost doubled! And if you perform each update in separate transaction, then size of database
will be almost unchanged (because space of allocated shadow objects will be reused in this case).
So the best approach is to perform commit after 100 or 1000 updates, it will
reduce overhead of each commit and save database size.<P>


If your persistent object form tree or graph where all objects cab be accessed by reference from the root object,
then once you will load root object in main memory and store reference to it in some variable, 
GC will never be able to collect any instance of loaded persistent object (because it will be accessible from
the root object). So when you application access more and more objects from the database, 
at some moment of time all of them will have to be loaded in main memory. It can cause space exhaustion.
To prevent this situation you should avoid to store in variables references to container objects which 
contain references to a large number of members. Especially it is true for database root object.
In this case GC is able to do it work and throw out from the memory objects which are not used 
at this moment (to which there are no references from local variable). 
But it is important to say that objects accessible though the index by key can be normally deallocated by garbage
collector. So in this case special care is not needed.<P>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd><p>

<dt><i>Can Key class be stores in database?</i></dt>
<dd>
A Key class is *not* persistent capable and can thus *not* be stored. If 
one wants to have it readily available one can make it transient and 
instantiate it through the onLoad() method or via the default 
constructor of the class.
</dd><p>

<dt><i>How to defined constructors for persistent objects?</i></dt>
<dd>
The normal default constructor of a class is always used by Volante when 
loading objects.
This implies that when one needs to create attributes that are to remain 
one has to either:
<UL>
<LI>Check for oid existence on the object (if oid then object already 
exists in the db)
<LI>Leave the default constructor as is and introduce an alternate 
constructor that is only called on new object creation.
</ul>
<p>
Initialization of transient attributes or resettable attributes should/ 
can be done via the default constructor or the onLoad() method, which is 
called when an object is retrieved from the db.
</dd><p>

<dt><i>When redefinition of recursiveLoading method is needed?</i></dt>
<dd>By default Volante recursively load all referenced objects.
So once you access some persistent object, the complete closure of persistent objects,
directly or indirectly reachable from this object by references, is loaded.
So in theory loading of root object can cause loading of all objects in the database.
If it is not desired (because loading of all objects will take significant amount of time or because
it will cause memory exhaustion), then you should stop recursion by redefinition of 
<code>recursiveLoading</code> method in some classes. You should explicitly load all object referenced
from object with disabled recursive loading. 
<P>
But really situation is better. It is important to notice that all Volante collection classes
always load their members on demand. It means that once you have reference for example to FielIndex, 
only header of this collection object will be loaded and members will be loaded on demand. 
It is true for all other Volante collections: Link, Relation, Index, SortedCollection, PersistentSet. 
As far as persistent objects in database are usually accessible through collections, in 
most cases explicit loading of persistent objects is not needed. But be careful: if in addition 
to placing all your objects in some index, you also link them for example in L2-List, then
fetching single object will cause loading of all other objects from this collection!
</dd><p>

<dt><i>How to store classes not derived from Persistent?</i></dt>
<dd>
Volante allows to store transient objects using standard .NET serialization mechanism. Volante will correctly handle reference to persistent object from serialized transient objects.  But it is important to notice, that identity of saved transient objects is not preserved. If there was transient object O referenced from persistent objects P1 and P2, then when objects P1 and P2 are stored, instance of O object will be serialized both in P1 and P2 record. And when P1 and P2 object will be reloaded from the database, them will refer to different instances O1 and O2. Also please notice, that is impossible to mark transient objects is modified. Of some of referenced transient objects is updated, you should also update persistent object referencing (directly or indirectly) this object.</dd><p>

<dt><i>When commit transaction?</i></dt>
<dd>
Commit operation requires synchronous write to the disk. It is very slow operation (modern disks
are not able to perform more than 100 such operations per second). So to improve performance it is
better to perform commit not so frequent. But certainly you should realize than once some problem
arrives (application or system crash or just power fault), then all uncommitted data will be lost.
</dd>

<dt><i>How to deallocate objects?</i></dt>
<dd>
Volante doesn't automatically exclude deleted object from any indices containing
this object. So it is responsibility of programmer to remove object
from all indices before it is deallocated.<BR>
Volante also doesn't remove any object referenced from removed object.
If it is needed - programmer should do it himself.<BR>
Explicit deletion of object can cause two problems:
<UL>
<LI>Dangling references (references to the removed objects).
<LI>Garbage in the database (unreferenced objects).
</UL>
First problem is most critical and can cause database data corruption.
To prevent this problem it is strongly recommended to use Volante garbage collector
instead of explicit memory deallocation. If it is not possible (due to performance 
or some other reasons), it still can be used for debugging, since Volante GC is able to detect 
both problems: it will throw <code>DatabaseException(DatabaseError.ErrorCode.INVALID_OID)</code> exception
if reference to the deleted object is found and return non zero number of collected objects
if there is garbage in the database. 

<dt><i>Why application normally working in single-threaded mode got
assertion failures or some other exceptions if database is updated by mode than one thread?</i></dt>
<dd>
Volante by itself doesn't synchronize access to the persistent objects. It is responsibility of application to set proper locks to avoid concurrent access to the same object. So just using <code>BeginThreadTransaction()</code> and <code>EndThreadTransaction()</code> is not enough for correct concurrent work with persistent objects. So the following alternatives are possible:

1. Access database only from one thread
2. Access database from multiple thread but use global lock to provide
mutual exclusion of each thread. So thread lock mutex, do some
operations with database, commit transaction and unlock mutex.
3. Use per-thread transactions in EXCLUSIVE_TRANSACTION mode.
This approach is similar to 2), but Volante will provide exclusion of
threads itself.
4. Use per-thread transactions in application_TRANSACTION mode +
objet level locking + alternative B-Tree implementation.

Please notice that in alternative 1-3 only one thread is accessing
database at each moment of time, so it is not possible to say about
concurrent execution. But it doesn't mean that with approach 4) you
will get the best performance - because of locking overhead and
alternative B-Tree implementation which is less efficient than
original implementation for very large databases.
Also approach 4 is most difficult to program - because setting proper
locks is responsibility of programmer and incorrect locking can cause
synchronization problems: race conditions (as you have with
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) or deadlocks (two or more threads
mutually block each other).
