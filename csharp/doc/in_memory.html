	<p><a href=index.html>Volante</a> : Using Volante as in-memory database</p>

	<p>The main use case for Volante is to easily persist application's data between session. It can also be used as an in-memory database. Because writing to disk is the slowest part of any database system, in-memory use offers dramatically higher performance.</p>

	<p>There are two possibilities:
	<ul>
		<li>no persistence</li>
		<li>with persistence</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>In both cases the whole data set has to fit in RAM.</p>

	<h3>In-memory use without persistence</h3>

	<p>In that mode the data is gone after application quits. Good for completely transient data.</p>

	<p>This mode is enabled by passing NullFile() instance and 0 for pagePoolSize to Database.Open().</p>

	<p>TODO: code example</p>

	<h3>In-memory use with persistence</h3>

	<p>In this mode all the operations are done in memory but the database is persisted to disk when database is closed. This is faster than standard mode because there's less disk I/O during the operations.</p>

	<p>The downside is that if the application crashes and the database is not closed, all the data will be lost.</p>

	<p>This mode is enabled by passing 0 for pagePoolSize to Database.Open().</p>

	<p>TODO: code example</p>
