Things to do for c# version:

* fix a TestInsertShort and TestInsertUShort bug where can't find short.MaxValue and 1999 in the index (grep for FAILED_TEST)
* make a reference API from .xml extracted during build process
* get rid of IDatabase.StringEncoding and always use utf8 for storing strings (?)
* make a release script that builds and uploads .zip with the Volante.dll
* finish manual:
 * index_link.html
 * index_array.html
 * index_relation.html
 * index_time_series.html
 * index_patricia.html
 * transactions.html
 * schema_evolution.html
 * benchmarks
 * document recursive loading somewhere (?)
 * an example of persisted double-linked list
 * who uses Volante?
* remove CreateScalableSet() from public API and change to CreateSet, rename CreateSet to CreateBtreeSet
* script that copies docs to my website (i.e. my blog repository)
* make a 0.9 release

After 0.9:
* silverlight version
* wp7 versions
* re-implement BitIndexImp.cs using AltBtree
* implement MemFile : IFile which to use for tests that need database to be closed and re-opened (and currently use file on disk for that)
* benchmark Bytes.unpack*() using unsafe fixed vs. bit fiddling
* benchmark using standard stream vs. compressed (gzip) stream for database file

Notes:
* building without (old) Btree code saves 48kB (264 => 216)

Test coverage notes:
* 52%   on 2011-08-06
* 59.5% on 2011-08-24
* 61.4% on 2011-08-26
