Things to do for c# version:

* write docs
* silverlight version
* wp7 versions
* get rid of IDatabase.StringEncoding and always use utf8 for storing strings (?)
* make a release script that builds and uploads .zip with the Volante.dll
* fix a bug where index enumerator for range where being and end are the same value returns all values instead of 1 (if a key is in the database) or 0 (if the key isn't in the database)
* make a 0.9 release

After 0.9:
* re-implement BitIndexImp.cs using AltBtree

Notes:
* building without (old) Btree code saves 48kB (264 => 216)
