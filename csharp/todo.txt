Things to do for c# version:

* fix a TestInsertShort and TestInsertUShort bug where can't find short.MaxValue and 1999 in the index (grep for FAILED_TEST)
* figure out why guid tests fail in mono
* make a release script that builds and uploads .zip with the Volante.dll
* write download.html
* script that copies docs to my website (i.e. my blog repository)
* make a reference API from .xml extracted during build process (after 0.9?)
* g+ button in the website version of docs
* more code coverage tests:
 * replication
 * BtreeFieldIndex
 * BtreeMultiFieldIndex
 * LinkImpl
 * OldBtreeFieldIndex
 * OldBtreeMultiFieldIndex
 * PTrie
 * Relation
 * RTree
 * RTreeR2
 * ThickIndex
 * Ttree
 * TtreePage
 * WeakHashTable
 * L2List
 * L2ListElem
 * PersistentString
 * Projection
 * Rc4File
 * Relation
* document setting IFile.NoFlush to true in performance_tuning.html
* make a 0.9 release

After 0.9:
* document projection
* silverlight version
* wp7 versions
* "who uses Volante" section in docs
* benchmarks info
* an example of persisted double-linked list
* re-implement BitIndexImp.cs using AltBtree
* implement MemFile : IFile which to use for tests that need database to be closed and re-opened (and currently use file on disk for that)
* benchmark Bytes.unpack*() using unsafe fixed vs. bit fiddling
* benchmark using standard stream vs. compressed (gzip) stream for database file
* write a blog post about small size of Volante.dll (compare to e.g. log4net)

Notes:
* building without (old) Btree code saves 48kB (264 => 216)
