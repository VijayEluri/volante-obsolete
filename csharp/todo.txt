Things to do for c# version:

* fix a TestInsertShort and TestInsertUShort bug where can't find short.MaxValue and 1999 in the index (grep for FAILED_TEST)
* remove WITH_OLD_BTREE code, rename AltBtree to Btree
* figure out why guid tests fail in mono
* make a reference API from .xml extracted during build process
* get rid of IDatabase.StringEncoding and always use utf8 for storing strings (?)
* make a release script that builds and uploads .zip with the Volante.dll
* finish manual:
 * index_relation.html
 * document tweaking performance
* write download.html page
* script that copies docs to my website (i.e. my blog repository)
* make a 0.9 release

After 0.9:
* document projection
* silverlight version
* wp7 versions
* "who uses Volante" section in docs
* benchmarks info
* an example of persisted double-linked list
* re-implement BitIndexImp.cs using AltBtree
* implement MemFile : IFile which to use for tests that need database to be closed and re-opened (and currently use file on disk for that)
* benchmark Bytes.unpack*() using unsafe fixed vs. bit fiddling
* benchmark using standard stream vs. compressed (gzip) stream for database file

Notes:
* building without (old) Btree code saves 48kB (264 => 216)
