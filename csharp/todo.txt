Things to do for c# version:

* benchmark altbtree vs. old btree and remove the old 
  if altbtree proves to be always faster. Note: requires
  either removing BinIndex.cs or re-implementing BitIndexImp.cs
  in terms of AltBtree
* make a release script that builds and uploads .zip with the Volante.dll
* write docs
* silverlight and wp7 versions
* make a 0.9 release
* change Hashtables to Dictionary<> (e.g. classDescMap, resolvedTypes in StorageImpl.cs)
* rename PerstSink to VolanteSink
* get rid of Storage.StringEncoding and always use utf8 for storing strings (?)
* remove CacheType - just use the best cache (?)
* always set SerializeTransientObjects = true (?)

Notes:
* building without (old) Btree code saves 48kB (264 => 216)
