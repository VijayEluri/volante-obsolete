Things to do for c# version:

* fix a bug where index enumerator for range where being and end are the same value returns all values instead of 1 (if a key is in the database) or 0 (if the key isn't in the database)
* finish manual:
 * transactions
 * CreateIndex()
 * CreateThickIndex()
 * CreateFieldIndex()
 * CreateSpatialIndex() / CreateSpatialIndexR2()
 * CreateSortedCollection()
 * CreateSet()
 * CreateLink()
 * CreateScalableSet()
 * CreateArray()
 * CreateRelation()
 * CreateBlob()
 * CreateTimeSeries()
 * CreatePatriciaTree()
 * who uses Volante?
* change naming on MemoryUsage class
* make a reference API from .xml extracted during build process
* get rid of IDatabase.StringEncoding and always use utf8 for storing strings (?)
* make a release script that builds and uploads .zip with the Volante.dll
* make a 0.9 release

After 0.9:
* silverlight version
* wp7 versions
* re-implement BitIndexImp.cs using AltBtree
* implement MemFile : IFile which to use for tests that need database to be closed and re-opened (and currently use file on disk for that)

Notes:
* building without (old) Btree code saves 48kB (264 => 216)

Test coverage notes:
* 52%   on 2011-08-06
* 59.5% on 2011-08-24
