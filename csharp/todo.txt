Things to do for c# version:

* update opencover and ReportGenerator to latest versions
* fix a TestInsertShort and TestInsertUShort bug where can't find short.MaxValue and 1999 in the index (grep for FAILED_TEST)
* rename AltBtree to Btree, Btree to BtreeOld
* figure out why guid tests fail in mono
* get rid of IDatabase.StringEncoding and always use utf8 for storing strings (?)
* make a release script that builds and uploads .zip with the Volante.dll
* script that copies docs to my website (i.e. my blog repository)
* write download.html
* make a reference API from .xml extracted during build process (after 0.9?)
* g+ button in the website version of docs
* remove redundant Size() methods (if Length or Count are already provided due to implementing some other interface)
* add callback object to IFIle for monitoring i/o operations
* more coverage tests
* make a 0.9 release

After 0.9:
* document projection
* silverlight version
* wp7 versions
* "who uses Volante" section in docs
* benchmarks info
* an example of persisted double-linked list
* re-implement BitIndexImp.cs using AltBtree
* implement MemFile : IFile which to use for tests that need database to be closed and re-opened (and currently use file on disk for that)
* benchmark Bytes.unpack*() using unsafe fixed vs. bit fiddling
* benchmark using standard stream vs. compressed (gzip) stream for database file
* write a blog post about small size of Volante.dll (compare to e.g. log4net)

Notes:
* building without (old) Btree code saves 48kB (264 => 216)

Test coverage notes:
* 52%   on 2011-08-06
* 59.5% on 2011-08-24
* 61.4% on 2011-08-26
