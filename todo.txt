All the possible things to do next.

For both Java and C#:
 * write a test app that scans directories and stores the information
   in the database, to see how big the database is and how fast the access
   is to information about files/directories
 * auto-generate docs and put them on web page
 * write docs on how to work on Volante codebase
 * write even more tests
 * make releases and push them to my s3, link from a webpage
 * ambitious: add integrated, small full-text search (maybe port FTS 
   from SQliteSharp but store indexes in NachoDB)

C# specific:
 * make TestBlob verify both before closing and after closing database
 * add Silverligth target and test with Silverlight
 * ambitious: add LINQ support

Java specific:
 * test with other jvms (e.g. http://jamvm.sourceforge.net/)
 * change namespace to volante.org
 * Unix makefile and 
 * maybe: write ant makefile (to make it easy to run from eclipse)
