Next++:
 * fix TestBlob.cs
 * write a test app that scans directories and stores the information
   in the database, to see how big the database is and how fast the access
   is to information about files/directories
 * write a basic web page (host on github with their pages thingy?)
 * auto-generate docs and put them on web page
 * better test framework (steal ideas from sqlite?)
 * write docs on how to work on NachoDB codebase
 * write docs on how to use NachoDB in your own code
 * write even more tests
 * test with other jvms (e.g. http://jamvm.sourceforge.net/)
 * make releases and push them to my s3, link from a webpage

Maybe:
 * write ant makefile (to make it easy to run from eclipse)
 
Ambitious:
 * add integrated full-text search (maybe port FTS from SQliteSharp but
   store indexes in NachoDB)
